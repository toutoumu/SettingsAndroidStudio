This means that the given observer will receive all events and will never be automatically removed. You should manually call {@link removeObserver(Observer)} to stop observing this LiveData. While LiveData has one of such observers, it will be considered as active." />

      <item value="Launches a new coroutine without blocking the current thread and returns a reference to the coroutine as a [Job]. The coroutine is cancelled when the resulting job is [cancelled][Job.cancel]. The coroutine context is inherited from a [CoroutineScope]. Additional context elements can be specified with [context] argument. If the context does not have any dispatcher nor any other [ContinuationInterceptor], then [Dispatchers.Default] is used. The parent job is inherited from a [CoroutineScope] as well, but it can also be overridden with a corresponding [context] element. By default, the coroutine is immediately scheduled for execution. Other start options can be specified via `start` parameter. See [CoroutineStart] for details. An optional [start] parameter can be set to [CoroutineStart.LAZY] to start coroutine _lazily_. In this case, the coroutine [Job] is created in _new_ state. It can be explicitly started with [start][Job.start] function and will be started implicitly on the first invocation of [join][Job.join]. Uncaught exceptions in this coroutine cancel the parent job in the context by default (unless [CoroutineExceptionHandler] is explicitly specified), which means that when `launch` is used with the context of another coroutine, then any uncaught exception leads to the cancellation of the parent coroutine. See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for a newly created coroutine. @param context additional to [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] context of the coroutine. @param start coroutine start option. The default value is [CoroutineStart.DEFAULT]. @param block the coroutine code which will be invoked in the context of the provided scope." />
