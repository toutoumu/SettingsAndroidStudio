      <item value="This method replaces the {@link BleManagershouldAutoConnect()} method. &lt;p&gt; Sets whether to connect to the remote device just once (false) or to add the address to white list of devices that will be automatically connect as soon as they become available (true). In the latter case, if Bluetooth adapter is enabled, Android scans periodically for devices from the white list and, if an advertising packet is received from such, it tries to connect to it. When the connection is lost, the system will keep trying to reconnect to it. If method is called with parameter set to true, and the connection to the device is lost, the {@link BleManagerCallbacksonLinkLossOccurred(BluetoothDevice)} callback is called instead of {@link BleManagerCallbacksonDeviceDisconnected(BluetoothDevice)}. &lt;p&gt; This feature works much better on newer Android phone models and may have issues on older phones. &lt;p&gt; This method should only be used with bonded devices, as otherwise the device may change it's address. It will however work also with non-bonded devices with private static address. A connection attempt to a non-bonded device with private resolvable address will fail. &lt;p&gt; The first connection to a device will always be created with autoConnect flag to false (see {@link BluetoothDeviceconnectGatt(Context, boolean, BluetoothGattCallback)}). This is to make it quick as the user most probably waits for a quick response. If autoConnect is used (true), the following connections will be done using {@link BluetoothGattconnect()}, which forces the autoConnect parameter to true. @param autoConnect true to use autoConnect feature on the second and following connections. The first connection is always done with autoConnect parameter equal to false, to make it faster and allow to timeout it the device is unreachable. Default value is false. @return The request." />

      <item value="Connects with a Bluetooth LE GATT service and takes care of its notifications. The service runs as a foreground service, which is generally required so that it can run even while the containing app has no UI. It is also possible to have the service started up as part of the OS boot sequence using code similar to the following: &lt;pre&gt; class OsNotificationReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() { override fun onReceive(context: Context?, intent: Intent?) { when (intent?.action) { Start our Gatt service as a result of the system booting up Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED -&gt; { context?.startForegroundService(Intent(context, GattService::class.java)) } } } } &lt;pre&gt;" />

This is often used when you want a snapping position at the top or bottom of the screen, but want the entire grabbing widget to be visible.

See example: ```dart SnappingPosition.factor( positionFactor: 1.0, grabbingContentOffset: GrabbingContentOffset.bottom, ), ``` Or if you have a snapping position at the bottom of the screen, you usually use [GrabbingContentOffset.bottom].
